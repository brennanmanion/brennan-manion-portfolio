                        Entrepreneurship is my favorite hobby. I have started multiple e-commerce businesses, built digital arbitrage systems, and employed algorithm trading forex robots to increase my income. My favorite entrepreneur venture would be the clothing accessories brand Boss Authority, which I spent 12 months building and marketing.
                        <br/><br/>
                        While I was in Thailand, I found a product that solved a problem. The product is termed a ratchet belt. The ratchet belt is an automatically locking belt that is adjustable to a quarter inch. It has a ratchet component that allows you to seamlessly adjust the length of the belt by locking and unlocking the ratchet. It was perfect for people with thin waists, who struggle with belts that create uncomfortable hip chaffing. I was inspired to start my own e-commerce brand. I contacted a manufacturer in China who would produce 500 of these belts, and would laser engrave the buckle and emboss the leather strap with my brand logo. Upon receiving my product, I began marketing it. I ran social and digital marketing campaigns, and brought people in through paid search results, then re-targeted to those people on social platforms. I would run paid promotions through Instagram influencers who would promote the product and review the benefits of the belt. I would also run paid advertising towards people who had similar interests to those who converted my website. I would spend all my time promoting the brand and finding ways to increase conversions, while I hired freelancers to do the labor necessary to meet my objectives. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        When my interest in entrepreneurship was at itâ€™s infancy, I became aware of websites such as fiverr.com and upwork.com, where I could hire freelancers for contract work. I quickly learned that I would not be able to do everything myself, and furthermore, that it made more sense to pay a professional to do a quality job for an unfamiliar task while I perform my compensated work, than to try and learn how to perform the task and spend the necessary time to develop a quality result. I contracted the best freelancers to come up with a brand name, design a brand logo, build growth hack tools, build the designs for digital and social ads, research audiences for advertising, edit video, edit photography, create website designs, develop a website, and develop SEO. I paid freelancers to do the routine work of ad agency employees while I executed the marketing and built the brand. I built relationships with freelancers, gained exposure to marketing techniques that work, experienced the steps necessary to take a business off the ground, and learned how to take a concept and turn it into a business. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Boss Authority was my favorite entrepreneur venture. I am still obsessed with the photo and video content I created for the brand. I will continue to be enamored with the website design and the voice of the brand. I continue to use the product every single day. Learning how to market and run a business is priceless. When I start another business, I will be many steps ahead of where I was when I began my first business, and I am very thankful for all of the support I received and the experiences from following through with my ambitions.
